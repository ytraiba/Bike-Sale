# Bike-Sale Market Place 

The goal of this project was to create a marketplace that allows users to rent out their bikes to each other. Users can create an account with an email/password or through Google's user authentication. To create a new listing for your bike, go to the profile page, click 'create a new listing', and fill in the necessary information. All of my websites scale down to mobile devices, including Bike-Sale. I used Firebase to create/authenticate users and store listings in a database, utilized Google's geocoding API and react-leaflet to display geographic information, and created private routes in react-router using custom hooks.
